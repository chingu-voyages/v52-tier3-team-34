## Overview

Imagine it’s evening, and you’re in a bustling city, searching for a cozy bar with live blues, jazz, or flamenco music playing. This application, **Live Music Finder**, is designed for people who want to discover venues with live music happening in real time, without the wait associated with big concert events. This web-based MVP allows users to see which places have live music right now, or in the near future.

- **User (Client)**: Can view locations with live music on a map, filter events by start time, and access basic event details.
- **Venue Owner**: Can register their venue, set map coordinates, upload at least one picture of their bar, and create events for their venue.
